# omero-web-image-picker

I had the need to build a way to comfortably select images in an Omero web app I created (or at least more comfortably than knowing the id). This project aims to provide just that functionality.

## Overview

* Uses JsTree to display groups – projects – datasets - images
* Displays thumbnails when hovering over an image
* I used the icons from [Omero](https://github.com/openmicroscopy/openmicroscopy) in the tree
